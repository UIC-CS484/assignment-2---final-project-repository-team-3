# CS 484 - "Pokemon Tracker" Project

## Testing

### Tests Created

"Test Register" - Registration failure due to bad (missing) input - Makes sure that accounts are not created when given improper input

"Test Register" - Registration success when given proper input - Makes sure that accounts are successfully created

### Information

The above tests cover all the registration feature's logic. 

Future tests should follow a similar structure and tests.

So far, we've made use of tables to show the user's favorite Pokemon. This table is sortable and users can view their most recently or oldest favorited pokemon in their collection. Users can also order results alphabetically.

More data visualization is planned to be added but not concrete.
